# Bikesharing Overview
This repository contains a business presentation for a new bikesharing company based in Des Moines, Iowa. Using data from the NYC CitiBike scheme, I have created a number of visualizations to better understand the bikesharing business model and to highlight the opportunity to invest in a similar scheme in Iowa. 

The analysis was completed using CSV Bikesharing data from NYC in the month of August 2019, as well as the software programs Tableau, Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library. My [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/luke.newell#!/vizhome/NYCCitibikeAnalysis_16115378960730/BikesharingStory "Check out my Tableau Story here!") contains the interactive charts seen below. The presentation is publically accessible, so please do take the time to check it out!
## Results
### Overview Dashboard
In the month of August, over 2.3 million rides were completed in NYC. The majority of customer using the service are regular subscribers (over 80%) with men being the primary user demographic (over 65%). Younger people tend to use the service more than older people, but there is a strong demand across a wide variety of age groups.
